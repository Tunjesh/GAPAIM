#Instructions for Completing the GAP-AIM Risk Register

The GAP-AIM risk register is designed to help your organization assess, prioritize, and manage AI risks in alignment with your organizational goals, risk apetite and trust principles.
Each AI use case should be documented and scored using the following steps:

## **Step 1: Define the Organizational Goal**

* For each AI principle, clearly state the **goal or intended outcome** of deploying the system. i.e goal of meeting a particular principle.
* Example: For principle= Bias/Fairness, goal can be “Ensure fair loan distribution to farmers across demographics.”

## **Step 2: Describe the Risk Scenario**

* Identify a **risk scenario** that could undermine the goal.
* Example: “AI model unfairly denies loans to certain groups (e.g., women, rural farmers).”

## **Step 3: Identify the Effect of the Risk Scenario**

* Explain the **potential impact** of the scenario if it occurs.
* Example: “Exclusion of vulnerable groups, reputational damage, regulatory sanctions”

## **Step 4: Determine Potential Causes**

* Record **what factors could lead to the risk senerio**.
* Example: “Biased training data or flawed model design.”

## **Step 5: Document Existing Controls**

* List current **policies, safeguards, or processes** in place to mitigate the risk.
* Example: “Bias testing, representative datasets, fairness audits.”

## **Step 6: Score the GAP-AIM Dimensions**

For each risk scenario, assign a score (1–3) for the following GAP-AIM dimensions:

1. **A (Addressability 
2. **I (Impact):**
3. **M (Mitigation):** 
The AIM score and traffic ligth will be automatically populated.

## **Step 7: Recommend Actions**

* Based on the GAP-AIM score, define **actions required to reduce risk**.
* Example: “Add automated compliance checks in chatbot training pipeline.”

## **Step 8: Assign Responsibility & Timeline**

* Assign a **responsible owner** (e.g., AI Team Lead, Compliance Officer).
* Set a **completion date** for the recommended action.

## **Step 9: Conduct Post-Assessment**

* After implementing the recommended actions, **re-score the GAP-AIM dimensions** - under **"Action Result"**  section
* Compare **pre-assessment vs. post-assessment scores** to track risk reduction.

## **Step 10: Record & Maintain**

* Save the updated GAP-AIM register entry in your organizational repository.
* Use the results to inform:

  * **Risk prioritization**
  * **AI governance reporting**
  * **Continuous monitoring & improvement**
